					<h2>Food</h2>

				<br/>
				<li>There is a lot of dish that i like to taste.</li>
				<br/>
				<h2>SUSHIS</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/food.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="sushi">I want to go in Japan for to taste the best Sushi.  SUSHI originates in the Baiyue cuisine in ancient southern China, a dish known as narezushi ,
				stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from
				spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important
				source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated
				(shi) terminal-form conjugation,sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be
				sour";the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty,
				notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.<br/>
				Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
				It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
				of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
				daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Maple Syrup</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/food1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="syrup">Pancake with Maple syrup YUMMY .I'm ready to go in Quebec just for to taste the best Maple Syrup.  Maple Syrup is a syrup usually made from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, although it can
				also be made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before
				winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are
				tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of
				the water, leaving the concentrated syrup. Most trees can produce 20 to 60 litres (5 to 15 US gallons) of sap per
				season.
				
				Maple syrup was first made and used by the indigenous peoples of North America.The practice was adopted by European
				settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup
				processing. Virtually all of the world's maple syrup is produced in Canada and the United States. The Canadian province
				of Quebec is the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in
				2016 were C$487 million (about US$360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total</p>
