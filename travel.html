					<h2>Travel That i like to do</h2>
				</header>

				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtDnvn9r_8I" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/travel.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>I had the chance to participate king's day in the netherlands but I was not able to participate of glastonbury
				music festival due to lack of financial means, there are so many things that I dream of doing. That is why I dream of being a digital nomad and that the profession of web developer attracts me because I can live
				this life, if I manage to achieve this profession.<br/>
				<h5>Here is the list of events I want to do while being in the prime of life.</h5>
				<br/>
				<h2>Songkran</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/songkran.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<br/>
				<p class="songkran"> In Thailand, New Year is now officially celebrated on 1 January. Songkran was the official New Year until 1888, when it
				was switched to a fixed date of 1 April. Then in 1940, this date was shifted to 1 January. The traditional Thai New Year
				Songkran was transformed into a national holiday<br/>
				The Songkran celebration is rich with symbolic traditions. Mornings begin with merit-making. Visiting local temples and
				offering food to the Buddhist monks is commonly practiced. On this specific occasion, performing water pouring on Buddha
				statues and the young and elderly is a traditional ritual, representing purification and the washing away of one's sins
				and bad luck. As a festival of unity, people who have moved away usually return home to their loved ones and elders.
				Paying reverence to ancestors is an important part of Songkran tradition.<br/>
				
				The holiday is known for its water festival. Major streets are closed to traffic, and are used as arenas for water
				fights. Celebrants, young and old, participate in this tradition by splashing water on each other. Traditional parades
				are held and in some venues "Lady Songkran" or "Miss Songkran" is crowned. Where contestants are clothed in
				traditional Thai dress.</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Boryeong Mud Festival</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/Boryeong-Mud-Festival .jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="boryeong">Although the festival takes place over a period of around two weeks, it is most famous for its final weekend, which is
				popular with Korea's western population. The final weekend of the festival is normally on the second weekend in July.<br/>

				The Boryeong Mud Festival is an annual festival which takes place during the summer in Boryeong, a town around 200 km
				south of Seoul, South Korea. The first Mud Festival was staged in 1998 and, by 2007, the festival attracted 2.2 million
				visitors to Boryeong.<br/>
				
				The mud is taken from the Boryeong mud flats, and trucked to the Daecheon beach area, where it is used as the
				centrepiece of the 'Mud Experience Land. The mud is considered rich in minerals and used to manufacture cosmetics.
				The festival was originally conceived as a marketing vehicle for Boryeong mud cosmetics
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Carnival of Rio</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/carnival.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="carnival">The carnival of Rio is a festival held every year before Lent and considered the biggest carnival in the world with two million people per day on the streets. The first Carnival festival in Rio occurred in 1723<br/>
				The typical Rio carnival parade is filled with revelers, floats, and adornments from numerous samba schools which are
				located in Rio<br/>
				There is also the street carnival .The parade is taking place in the Sambadrome and the balls are being held in the Copacabana Palace and beach, many
				carnival participants are at other locations. Street festivals are very common during carnival and are highly populated
				by the locals.[14] Elegance and extravagance are usually left behind, but music and dancing are still extremely common.
				Anyone is allowed to participate in the street festivals. Bandas are very familiar with the street carnival especially
				because it takes nothing to join in on the fun except to jump in. One of the most well known bandas of Rio is Banda de
				Ipanema. Banda de Ipanema was first created in 1965 and is known as Rio's most irreverent street band.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Lantern Festival</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/chiang_mai.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="chiang_mai">In Chiang Mai, Loy Krathong is preceded by Yee Peng (The Lantern Festival), during which people release floating
				lanterns into the sky. It is during Yee Peng that you see locals' homes and public places decked out in colourful
				hanging lanterns and flag decorations. The act of releasing the lantern and krathong symbolizes letting go of all ills
				and misfortunes in the previous year, and Buddhists also believe that if you make a wish when you set off the lantern,
				it will come true (but only if you do good deeds the following year, of course).<br/>
				
				As part of this festival of lights, there are plenty of other activities that happen all over Chiang Mai. These include
				traditional Thai dance shows, the official ‘Yee Peng Parade’ around the Old City gate and down Tha Phae Road, live music
				and handicraft sessions. </p>
				<h2>Full Moon Party</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/full_moon_party.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="full_moon">Full Moon Party parties gained fame through word of mouth, and the event now draws a crowd of about 5,000–30,000 every full moon
				evening The party carries on until the sun rises the next day. The bars on Sunrise Beach of Hat Rin stay open and
				play music such as psychedelic trance, R&B, drum and bass, house, dance, and reggae. The modern event has become a part
				of the itinerary of many travelers to Southeast Asia.<br/>
				The Full Moon Party takes place every month[9] throughout the year. Its attractions include fire skipping ropes, alcohol
				"buckets", and drugs. There is a very wide spectrum of music ranging from trance, to drum and bass, to reggae. The party
				takes place in many clubs along the Hat Rin beach. The Full Moon Party in October 2017, and all other parties and music
				activities on Koh Pha-ngan, was canceled in respect for the cremation ceremony for the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej,
				October 25 to 29</p>
				<br/>
				<h2>Holi</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/holi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="holi">
				Holi is a popular ancient Hindu festival, also known as the "festival of spring", the "festival of colours", and the
				"festival of love". The festival signifies the triumph of good over evil. It originated and is
				predominantly celebrated in India, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through
				the diaspora from the Indian subcontinent<br/>In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deity Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in
				commemoration of the divine love of Radha for Krishna. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated
				as a festival of love. There is a symbolic myth behind commemorating Krishna as well. As a baby, Krishna developed
				his characteristic dark skin colour because the she-demon Putana poisoned him with her breast milk. In his youth,
				Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother, tired of
				his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This she did, and
				Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's face has been commemorated
				as Holi. Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah) are common in some
				Caribbean and South American communities of Indian origin such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. It is also
				celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius
				</p>
				This is one of the two meetings that I would like to go see.
				<br />
				<h2>Fla - Flu</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/fla-flu.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="fla_flu">
				Fla-Flu is a match between cross-town rivals Flamengo and Fluminense.The rivalry between these two clubs began in October 1911, when a group of dissatisfied players from Fluminense left the
				club, and went to Flamengo, which at the time had no football department. The first Fla–Flu ever was played the
				following year, on July 7, 1912 at Laranjeiras stadium. Fluminense won this match 3–2, with 800 people in attendance
				<br />
				<h2>Superclasico</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/superclasico.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="boca_river">
				If there was one game that I had to choose to see in my whole life it would be this one, this is the football game that
				I absolutely want to see.<br/>
				Superclásico is the football match in Argentina between Buenos Aires rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. It derives
				from the Spanish usage of "clásico" to mean derby, with the prefix "super" used as the two clubs are the most popular
				and successful clubs in Argentine football. In fact, the term 'Clásico' originated in Argentina, particularly with this
				match up and it was later exported to other countries such as Spain and Mexico. According to some statistics, they
				commandeer more than 70% of all Argentine football fans between them.<br/>
				The Superclásico is known worldwide as one of the fiercest and most important derbies.
				In April 2004, the English newspaper The Observer put the Superclásico at the top of their list of "50 sporting things
				you must do before you die, saying that.<br/>
				The Daily Telegraph ranked this match as the biggest club rivalry in world football in 2016, and the Daily Mirror
				placed it number one in the top 50 football derbies in the world, above El Clásico between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid
				C.F.

				<h2>La Tomatina</h2>
				<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/img/tomatina.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p class="tomatina">
				La Tomatina is a festival that is held in the Valencian town of Buñol, in the East of Spain 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the
				Mediterranean, in which participants throw tomatoes and get involved in a tomato fight purely for entertainment
				purposes. Since 1945 it has been held on the last Wednesday of August, during a week of festivities in Buñol.<br/>
				La Tomatina Festival started the last Wednesday of August in 1945 when some young people spent the time in the town
				square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young boys decided to take part in a parade with
				musicians, Giants and Big-Heads figures. The energy of jovialities caused one participant's Big-head to fall off. The
				participant flew into a fit of rage, began hitting everything in his path. There was a market stall of vegetables that
				fell victim to the fury of the crowd. People started to pelt each other with tomatoes until the local forces ended the
				fruit battle.
