					<h2>Apple Cartography</h2>
				</header>

				<a href="https://www.apple.com/maps/" class="image featured"><img src="images/apple_tx.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>News for my experience in Apple<br /> I had some interview before to join Apple
				I followed a traineeship and then we are collected some streets.<br />
				You should be carefully about your environment,your neighborhood,the peoples and so on.<br />
				each cities ,there is one or many dangerous district with thugs peoples.<br />We had collected this area earlier in the
				morning when the thugs sleep.
				Your collect some area ,you work with your colleague , you are free for to take the lunch and for your mission, Each
				days you have a new mission if you did not finish yesterday mission.<br />
				To be honest, i really loved my life in the netherlands, better than in france, people are more respectful, less
				suspicious, the working atmosphere is better than in france, there is no indirect racism like in France. The Dutch are
				kind to each other.
				the netherlands gives everyone a chance. It is very cosmopolitan we meet people who come from all over the world whether
				in eindhoven, amsterdam, The hague, Utrecht or Rotterdam. I loved the cycling culture and the feeling of freedom that it
				gave after working days. All the infrastructure of the country is made for bicycles, especially in utrecht and
				amsterdam.<br />
				<img src="images/img/carto.jpg">
				Every Dutch person I have met speaks English in everyday life in addition to Dutch. I find that fantastic, in France
				when we try to speak in English, we are then judged by people or we speak badly English and we are told, you have a bad
				accent and speak French ... it does not encourage you to develop your skills or either we speak good English and we are
				told stop being your show off. and that also does not encourage. In both directions we are pulled down, it's a crab
				basket environment<br/>
				<img src="images/img/carto1.jpg">
				To have a family life, it is one of the countries that I would choose because the education system is efficient (the
				children speak several languages) the work system allows not only to earn a living and to get a family life because in
				the life this is a step to have a family life without hindering the professional career. Not only as a man but also as a
				woman. Many women work part-time and stay in senior positions as managers or project managers. All this while working 3
				days a week the same for men and it in no way affects the productivity of the company. Because according to several
				studies, a full-time employee loses more time with discussions at the coffee machine than part-time who devote 100% to
				work when he is on the premises of the company.</p>
